# DataSynthesizer_hw
project modification for DataSynthesizer

This is a project copy of the DataSynthesizer repo for the ProPublica Compas data (https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing).

This project explores the viability of generating statistically similar datasets while preserving the data set privacy, which is controlled by the parameter epsilon. Further theories can be found in the paper included in this repo.
